# Tone

### Content

When writing about membit, content should always reflect our brand’s core qualities: insightful, approachable, empowering, privacy-focused, and forward-thinking. Every piece of content—whether it’s a tweet, a help article, a product announcement, or a deep-dive report—should feel like it’s coming from the same membit “voice.”

Always keep your audience in mind. Content should be welcoming and direct, making even complex ideas easy to grasp. Avoid empty buzzwords or corporate jargon—write the way real people speak, and connect everything back to real conversations, not abstract concepts. Keep it personal and grounded. Don’t just describe what membit does; show how it helps people understand and participate in what matters right now.

### Important themes to focus on when creating membit Content:

**Privacy Focused**

Write with respect for boundaries. We communicate with care, without sharing personal information or encouraging invasive behaviour.

We also would like to highlight that Privacy is one of membit’s core Brand Value, so assurance regarding personal information, and activity tracking/monitoring beyond the social media window should be mentioned. Highlight that membit’s user’s privacy won’t be compromised.

Please avoid mentioning or using phrases such as: Spying, Data scraping, Bot-generated content, Fake news, etc.

Example: ✅ “membit highlights what’s trending across public conversations, while always respecting your privacy—no personal data is shared, and your activity stays your own.”

**Tagline - ‘Context’**

Context is a technical term used in AI. It refers to the surrounding information or circumstances that help models make sense of training data. But it isn’t just a Buzzword, it’s the heart of what membit delivers, so good membit content should spotlight the power of Context, making clear it’s what transforms isolated facts or trends into real understanding. Every mention of membit should highlight how Context turns information into real insight.

Example: ✅ “membit provides Context, not just the raw comments or numbers, but who said it, when, and what else was happening, so AI (and you) can understand the full story”

---

### Context

The tone of membit content adapts to the moment. Our community is diverse, and the conversations we surface can range from lighthearted memes to sensitive world events. It’s important that content creators understand the context in which they’re communicating and adjust their tone accordingly.

**Serious or Sensitive Moments:**

Approach with care, clarity, and respect. Avoid sensationalism, hype, or minimising people’s experiences. Focus on providing insight, support, and factual information. When highlighting issues that affect real people, be empathetic and balanced. Prioritise transparency and always respect privacy.

✅ “According to membit, discussions about online safety increased sharply after the recent hack, with many users sharing their personal stories and concerns. We’re highlighting the key themes and offering resources for those seeking support.”

Not this:
❌ “Not your keys, not your coins anon. There’s been some talk about online safety, but it’s probably not a big deal”

**Celebratory or Positive Moments:**

Highlight wins, creative ideas, and community milestones with enthusiasm. Keep the energy up and celebrate real achievements, but never at someone else’s expense. Be inclusive and let everyone feel invited to the celebration.

Like this:
✅ “It’s official: the membit community hit 10,000 members! Thanks to everyone for making this such a supportive, vibrant place.”

Not this:
❌ “membit just passed 10,000 members. Let’s hope we can keep the momentum going.”

**Humor and Memes:**

Memes are encouraged, but they should always be positive, clever, and in good taste. Use humour to connect, not to divide or exclude. Avoid anything that could be seen as mean-spirited, confusing, or inside-joke-heavy. Wholesome, universally funny, or insight-driven memes fit best with membit’s voice. Always ensure that the joke supports understanding, not just noise.

**Like this:**

✅ “When you check membit for the latest trend and it’s _already_ changed. (Insert ‘distracted boyfriend’ meme with ‘today’s trend’ and ‘tomorrow’s trend’)”

**Not this:**

❌ “If you’re not in on the joke, you’re NGMI. Don’t @ us. Dunking on specific people, or using NSFW language.”

**Like this:**

✅ “When membit spots a trend before your group chat does: _that feeling when you’re ahead of the curve_ 😎📈”

**Not this:**

❌ “People who don’t check membit: 🤡”

**General Principles and examples:**

- Know your audience and what’s happening in the wider world before you publish.
- When in doubt, err on the side of empathy and clarity.
- Aim for content that is approachable, insightful, empowering, and forward-thinking—regardless of the context.
