Membit's power comes from a sophisticated data pipeline that transforms raw, user-generated content into structured, high-signal context for AI agents. This process involves a unique combination of human curation and automated processing.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Data Hunters Contribute Content">
    <img

      alt="Data Hunters Contribute Content"
      className="rounded-lg"
      noZoom
    />
    The process begins with our global network of **Data Hunters**. Using a browser
    extension, they capture relevant social media posts, news articles, and other
    online content as they browse. This human-in-the-loop approach ensures that we
    are sourcing content that is genuinely interesting and significant.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Verification and Filtering">
    <img

      alt="Verification and Filtering"
      className="rounded-lg"
      noZoom
    />
    Once submitted, the raw data enters our distributed infrastructure for validation.
    Automated checks and AI classifiers work to filter out spam, duplicates, and
    irrelevant content. This ensures that only high-quality, timely information proceeds
    to the next stage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Clustering and Analysis">
    <img
      src="/images/how-it-works/step-3.png"
      alt="Clustering and Analysis"
      className="rounded-lg"
      noZoom
    />
    The verified posts are then transformed into vector embeddings. An unsupervised
    clustering algorithm groups semantically related posts into "discussion clusters,"
    representing distinct narrative themes. We also apply a time-decayed engagement
    score to prioritize the most active and relevant conversations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: API Delivery">
    <img
      src="/images/how-it-works/step-4.png"
      alt="API Delivery"
      className="rounded-lg"
      noZoom
    />
    The final, structured context is made available through our developer-friendly
    API. AI developers can easily integrate this real-time data feed into their applications
    using our RESTful endpoints or the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.
