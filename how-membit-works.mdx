title: "How Membit Works"
---

Membit's data pipeline is designed to transform raw, user-generated content into a high-fidelity stream of context for your AI applications. Hereâ€™s how it works:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Data Contribution">
    **Data Hunters** contribute social posts they find valuable. This collective
    ranking process helps identify important and significant content from the
    noise.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verification and Filtering">
    Data sources are verified for authenticity. Irrelevant, duplicate, or
    unimportant posts are filtered out using automated checks and AI
    classifiers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clustering and Analysis">
    The top posts are grouped into thematic "discussion clusters" using an
    unsupervised clustering algorithm. This allows for easy searching and
    retrieval of context on specific topics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Context Delivery">
    Membit offers multiple connectors, including a REST API and an MCP server,
    allowing AI tools and agent platforms to easily access these clusters of
    information as context.
  </Step>
