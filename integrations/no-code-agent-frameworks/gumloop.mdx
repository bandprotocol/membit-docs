<Warning>
  **Current Integration Issue**: There are currently limitations with setting
  custom headers in the Gumloop MCP server configuration, which may prevent
  proper authentication with Membit's API. We are working to resolve this issue.
</Warning>

Gumloop is an intuitive no-code platform that enables you to build AI-powered workflows and automations. By integrating Membit with Gumloop, you can enhance your AI agents with real-time social context, allowing them to access current trends, breaking news, and live conversations from across the web.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An active Gumloop account ([sign up here](https://gumloop.com))
- A Membit account with an API key [get your API key](/access-and-auth)
- Basic familiarity with Gumloop's workflow builder

## Setting Up Membit MCP Server

Follow these steps to integrate Membit with your Gumloop workflows:

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Settings">

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="MCP Server Connection Issues">
**Problem**: Cannot connect to Membit MCP server in Gumloop

**Solutions**:

Verify the MCP server URL is correct: `https://mcp.membit.ai/mcp`

Check your API key is correct and active

Ensure the Additional Header format is exact: `X-Membit-Api-Key: <your-api-key>`

Try re-saving the MCP server credentials

Check if Gumloop has proper internet access

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authentication Failures">
**Problem**: API key authentication is failing

**Solutions**:

Verify your Membit API key is active in your dashboard

Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters in the API key

Check that the header name is exactly `X-Membit-Api-Key` (case-sensitive)

Try generating a new API key if the current one isn't working

Confirm your Membit account has sufficient credits/usage allowance

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Ask AI Node Configuration">
**Problem**: Ask AI node doesn't use Membit tools

**Solutions**:

Ensure "Connect MCP server" is set to **Yes**

Verify the "membit-mcp" server is selected in MCP servers dropdown

Try switching to Claude 4 Sonnet model for better tool usage

Make your prompt more explicit about using Membit: "Use membit to tell me about..."

Check if the workflow has proper permissions to access external servers
