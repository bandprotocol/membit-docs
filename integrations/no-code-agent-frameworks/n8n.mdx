n8n is a powerful workflow automation tool that allows you to connect different services and build sophisticated automation. By integrating Membit with n8n, you can enhance your AI agents with real-time social context, enabling them to provide up-to-date insights about trending topics, news, and conversations happening across the web.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An active n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)
- A Membit account with an API key ([get one here](https://membit.ai))
- Basic familiarity with n8n workflows and AI agents

<Tip>
  If you don't have a Membit API key yet, visit [membit.ai](https://membit.ai)
  and sign up for free to get instant access.

## Setting Up Membit MCP Client

Follow these steps to integrate Membit with your n8n workflows:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Node Panel">
In your n8n workflow editor, open the node panel to add a new node to your workflow.

</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Search for MCP Client">
In the node search bar, type "MCP client" to find the Model Context Protocol client tool.

  />
</Frame>

<Check>
The MCP Client Tool should appear in the search results. This tool enables n8n to communicate with external MCP servers like Membit.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Membit MCP Client">
Add the MCP Client Tool to your workflow and configure it with the following settings:

```
Endpoint: https://mcp.membit.ai/mcp
Server Transport: HTTP Streamable
Authentication: Header Auth
  - Name: X-Membit-Api-Key
  - Value: <your-api-key>
Tools to Include: All
```

<Warning>
Replace `<your-api-key>` with your actual Membit API key.
</Warning>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Building Your First Workflow

Now that your Membit MCP client is configured, let's create a complete workflow that uses real-time context:

<Steps>
<Step title="Add Required Nodes">
Create a complete workflow by adding and connecting the following nodes:

1. **Chat Trigger** - To receive user input
2. **AI Agent** - To process requests and coordinate responses
3. **Google Gemini Chat Model** - For natural language processing
4. **Membit MCP Client** - For real-time context

</Step>

<Step title="Connect the Nodes">
Connect them in this order:

- Chat Trigger → AI Agent
- Google Gemini Chat Model → AI Agent
- Membit MCP Client → AI Agent

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/n8n/example-workflow.png"
    alt="Complete n8n workflow showing connected nodes for Membit integration"
  />
</Frame>

<Check>
The visual connections show the data flow - the AI Agent receives input from the Chat Trigger, uses the Gemini model for processing, and accesses Membit for real-time context.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Test Your Workflow">
Use the chat interface to send a test message like:

```
"Tell me about crypto news"
```

or

```
"What's trending in AI today?"
```

Your AI agent should now respond with current, contextual information pulled from Membit's real-time data feed.

  <img
    src="/images/n8n/example-result.png"
    alt="n8n workflow execution result showing AI response with real-time context"
  />
</Frame>

<Check>
If successful, you'll see responses that include recent trends, discussions, and insights that wouldn't be available in static training data.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>
