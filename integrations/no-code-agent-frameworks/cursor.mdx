Cursor is an AI-powered code editor that enhances your development workflow with intelligent assistance. By integrating Membit with Cursor, you can access real-time social context directly within your coding environment, enabling your AI assistant to provide up-to-date insights about trending topics, current discussions, and breaking news while you work.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Cursor editor installed ([download here](https://cursor.com))
- A Membit account with an API key [get your API key](/access-and-auth)
- Basic familiarity with Cursor's interface and AI features

<Step title="Add Custom MCP">
  Click **Add Custom MCP** to create a new Model Context Protocol integration.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Membit Remote MCP">
Paste the following Membit remote MCP configuration into the configuration field:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "membit-mcp": {
      "url": "https://mcp.membit.ai/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-Membit-Api-Key": <your-api-key>
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
Replace `<your-api-key>` with your actual Membit API key. Keep this credential secure and don't share it with unauthorized users.
</Warning>

**Configuration Details:**

- **Server Name**: `membit-remote-mcp`
- **Command**: Uses npx to run the remote MCP client
- **Environment**: Empty object for default environment variables

</Step>

<Step title="Enable Membit Remote MCP">
After saving the configuration, turn on the **Membit Remote MCP** tool to activate the integration.

</Frame>

<Check>
Once enabled, Cursor's AI will have access to Membit's real-time context capabilities when processing your requests.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Using Membit with Cursor

Now that the integration is set up, you can start using Membit's real-time context in your development workflow:

<Steps>
<Step title="Start a Chat Session">
Open Cursor's chat interface and begin a conversation with the AI assistant.
</Step>

<Step title="Ask Context-Aware Questions">
Try asking questions that benefit from real-time context:

- "What are the latest trends in web development?"
- "Tell me about recent discussions in the AI community"
- "What's currently trending in cryptocurrency?"
- "Give me insights on the latest tech news"

<Note>
  When Cursor asks for permission to run tools, click **Run Tool** to allow
  access to Membit's real-time data. Cursor requests permission every time it
  uses external tools. You can bypass these permission prompts by adjusting the
  tool permissions in Cursor settings if desired.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Custom MCP Configuration Issues">
**Problem**: Custom MCP configuration fails to load or save

**Solutions**:

Verify the JSON configuration syntax is valid (no trailing commas, proper quotes)

Ensure the server name `membit-mcp` is unique and not conflicting

Check that the URL is exactly `https://mcp.membit.ai/mcp`

Try restarting Cursor after configuration changes

Validate the JSON structure matches the required format exactly

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="API Key Authentication Problems">
**Problem**: Membit API key authentication is failing

**Solutions**:

Verify your API key is correctly placed in the headers configuration

Ensure the header name is exactly `X-Membit-Api-Key` (case-sensitive)

Check that there are no extra spaces or characters around the API key

Confirm your Membit API key is active and has sufficient credits

Try generating a new API key if the current one isn't working

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tool Permission Prompts">
**Problem**: Cursor keeps asking for permission to run tools

**Solutions**:

Click "Run Tool" when prompted to allow Membit access for that session

Go to Cursor settings → Tools & Integrations → adjust tool permissions

Enable "Auto-approve safe tools" if available in your Cursor version

Consider the security implications before disabling permission prompts

Use "Always allow" option when prompted if you trust the Membit integration

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="MCP Server Not Responding">
**Problem**: Cursor can't connect to Membit MCP server

**Solutions**:

Check your internet connection and firewall settings

Verify the Membit MCP server is operational (try accessing the URL in browser)

Ensure Cursor has network access permissions on your system

Try toggling the MCP integration off and on again

Check Cursor's console/logs for specific error messages

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="AI Assistant Not Using Membit Tools">
**Problem**: Chat responses don't include real-time context

**Solutions**:

Make requests more explicit: "Use Membit to find current information about..."

Verify the Membit Remote MCP tool is enabled and active

Check that your questions relate to topics likely to have recent social media discussion

Try asking about trending topics that would benefit from real-time context

Ensure you're allowing tool usage when Cursor requests permission
