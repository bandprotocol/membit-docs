## Using Membit with Cursor

Now that the integration is set up, you can start using Membit's real-time context in your development workflow:

<Steps>
<Step title="Start a Chat Session">
Open Cursor's chat interface and begin a conversation with the AI assistant.
</Step>

<Step title="Ask Context-Aware Questions">
Try asking questions that benefit from real-time context:

- "What are the latest trends in web development?"
- "Tell me about recent discussions in the AI community"
- "What's currently trending in cryptocurrency?"
- "Give me insights on the latest tech news"

<Note>
  When Cursor asks for permission to run tools, click **Run Tool** to allow
  access to Membit's real-time data. Cursor requests permission every time it
  uses external tools. You can bypass these permission prompts by adjusting the
  tool permissions in Cursor settings if desired.
</Note>
