Flowise is a visual low-code platform for building AI-powered chatflows and agents. By integrating Membit with Flowise, you can enhance your AI agents with real-time social context, enabling them to access current trends, breaking news, and live conversations from across the web through a visual drag-and-drop interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An active Flowise instance (cloud or self-hosted)
- A Membit account with an API key [get your API key](/access-and-auth)
- Basic familiarity with Flowise's visual workflow builder
- A Google AI Studio API key for the chat model (optional)

## Setting Up Membit Custom MCP

Follow these steps to integrate Membit with your Flowise chatflows:

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Chatflows">
Navigate to your Flowise dashboard and click **Chatflows** in the menu bar to access the workflow builder.

</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Create New Chatflow">
Click **Add New** to start building a new chatflow from scratch.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/flowise/add-new.png" alt="Flowise add new chatflow button" />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Add Node Panel">
Click **Add Node** in the top left corner to open the node library.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/flowise/add-node.png" alt="Flowise add node button in workflow editor" />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Search for Custom MCP">
In the node search bar, type "Custom MCP" to find the Model Context Protocol integration node.

  />
</Frame>

<Check>
The Custom MCP node enables Flowise to connect with external MCP servers like Membit, providing real-time context to your chatflows.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Custom MCP Node">
Drag and drop the **Custom MCP** node to your chatflow board, then configure it with your Membit server details.

<Frame>

    alt="Custom MCP node configuration interface in Flowise"
  />
</Frame>

**MCP Server Configuration:**
Set the configuration using JSON format and replace with your Membit API key:

```json
{
  "url": "https://mcp.membit.ai/mcp",
  "headers": {
    "X-Membit-Api-Key": "{{$vars.MEMBIT_API_KEY}}"
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  To use your API key securely, create a `MEMBIT_API_KEY` variable in Flowise
</Warning>

After configuration, click the **refresh button** to load available actions, then select the actions you want to use.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Building Your First Chatflow

Now let's create a complete chatflow that uses Membit's real-time context:

<Steps>
<Step title="Add Chat Model">
Search for and add a **ChatGoogleGenerativeAI** node to handle the conversational AI.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/flowise/search-chat.png"
    alt="Searching for ChatGoogleGenerativeAI node in Flowise"
  />
</Frame>

**Configuration:**

- Set up your Google AI Studio API key credential
- Select your preferred model (e.g., Gemini Pro)

<Frame>
<img src="/images/flowise/chat-config.png" alt="ChatGoogleGenerativeAI node configuration in Flowise" />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Add Tool Agent">
Search for and add a **Tool Agent** node to coordinate between the chat model and external tools.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/flowise/search-tool-agent.png"
    alt="Searching for Tool Agent node in Flowise"
  />
</Frame>

<Check>
The Tool Agent acts as the orchestrator, managing how your chat model interacts with external tools like Membit.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Add Buffer Memory">
Search for and add a **Buffer Memory** node to maintain conversation context.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/flowise/search-buffer.png" alt="Searching for Buffer Memory node in Flowise" />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Connect the Nodes">
Connect all the nodes to create a functioning chatflow:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/flowise/connect-tools.png"
    alt="Connected Flowise chatflow showing all nodes linked together"
  />
</Frame>

**Connection Pattern:**

- **Custom MCP** → **Tools** (Tool Agent)
- **ChatGoogleGenerativeAI** → **Tool Calling Chat Model** (Tool Agent)
- **Buffer Memory** → **Memory** (Tool Agent)

<Tip>
The visual connections show the data flow - the Tool Agent receives tools from Custom MCP, uses the chat model for responses, and maintains memory for context.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Test Your Chatflow">
Once all nodes are connected, test your chatflow by starting a conversation.

<Frame caption="Testing the chatflow with real-time context from Membit">
  <img
    src="/images/flowise/talk-with-chat.png"
    alt="Flowise chat interface showing conversation with real-time context"
  />
</Frame>

<Check>
Try asking questions like "What's trending in AI today?" or "Tell me about recent crypto news" to see Membit's real-time context in action.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Custom MCP Configuration Issues">
**Problem**: Cannot configure or connect Custom MCP node

**Solutions**:

Verify the JSON configuration syntax is valid (no trailing commas, proper quotes)

Ensure the URL is exactly `https://mcp.membit.ai/mcp`

Check that the `MEMBIT_API_KEY` variable is properly set in Flowise

Try clicking the refresh button after configuration to load available actions

Restart Flowise after making configuration changes

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Environment Variable Problems">
**Problem**: API key variable not recognized in Flowise

**Solutions**:

Create a `MEMBIT_API_KEY` variable in Flowise's environment settings

Ensure the variable syntax in JSON uses `{{$vars.MEMBIT_API_KEY}}`

Verify there are no extra spaces or characters in the variable name

Check that your Membit API key is active and valid

Try restarting Flowise completely after setting environment variables

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tool Agent Connection Issues">
**Problem**: Tool Agent doesn't connect to Custom MCP properly

**Solutions**:

Ensure Custom MCP is connected to the "Tools" input of Tool Agent

Verify ChatGoogleGenerativeAI is connected to "Tool Calling Chat Model" input

Check that Buffer Memory is connected to "Memory" input

Confirm all connection lines are properly established and visible

Try disconnecting and reconnecting nodes in the correct sequence

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Chat Model Not Using Tools">
**Problem**: AI responses don't include real-time context from Membit

**Solutions**:

Verify the Google AI Studio API key is correctly configured

Ensure the chat model supports function calling (Gemini Pro recommended)

Make prompts more explicit: "Use available tools to search for current information about..."

Check that the Custom MCP actions are properly loaded and selected

Test with topics that are likely to have recent social media activity

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Chatflow Execution Errors">
**Problem**: Chatflow fails to execute or times out

**Solutions**:

Check all required inputs are connected and configured

Verify internet connectivity and firewall settings

Ensure your Google AI Studio API key has sufficient quota

Review Flowise logs for specific error messages

Try testing individual components before connecting the full flow
