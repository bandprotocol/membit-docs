Flowise is a visual low-code platform for building AI-powered chatflows and agents. By integrating Membit with Flowise, you can enhance your AI agents with real-time social context, enabling them to access current trends, breaking news, and live conversations from across the web through a visual drag-and-drop interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An active Flowise instance (cloud or self-hosted)
- A Membit account with an API key [get your API key](/access-and-auth)
- Basic familiarity with Flowise's visual workflow builder
- A Google AI Studio API key for the chat model (optional)

## Setting Up Membit Custom MCP

Follow these steps to integrate Membit with your Flowise chatflows:

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Chatflows">
Navigate to your Flowise dashboard and click **Chatflows** in the menu bar to access the workflow builder.

</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Create New Chatflow">
Click **Add New** to start building a new chatflow from scratch.

</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Add Node Panel">
Click **Add Node** in the top left corner to open the node library.

</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Search for Custom MCP">
In the node search bar, type "Custom MCP" to find the Model Context Protocol integration node.

</Frame>

<Check>
The Custom MCP node enables Flowise to connect with external MCP servers like Membit, providing real-time context to your chatflows.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Custom MCP Node">
Drag and drop the **Custom MCP** node to your chatflow board, then configure it with your Membit server details.

  />
</Frame>

**MCP Server Configuration:**
Set the configuration using JSON format and replace with your Membit API key:

```json
{
  "url": "https://mcp.membit.ai/mcp",
  "headers": {
    "X-Membit-Api-Key": "{{$vars.MEMBIT_API_KEY}}"
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  To use your API key securely, create a `MEMBIT_API_KEY` variable in Flowise
</Warning>

After configuration, click the **refresh button** to load available actions, then select the actions you want to use.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Building Your First Chatflow

Now let's create a complete chatflow that uses Membit's real-time context:

<Steps>
<Step title="Add Chat Model">
Search for and add a **ChatGoogleGenerativeAI** node to handle the conversational AI.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/flowise/search-chat.png"
    alt="Searching for ChatGoogleGenerativeAI node in Flowise"
  />
</Frame>

**Configuration:**

- Set up your Google AI Studio API key credential
- Select your preferred model (e.g., Gemini Pro)

<Frame>
<img src="/images/flowise/chat-config.png" alt="ChatGoogleGenerativeAI node configuration in Flowise" />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Add Tool Agent">
Search for and add a **Tool Agent** node to coordinate between the chat model and external tools.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/flowise/search-tool-agent.png"
    alt="Searching for Tool Agent node in Flowise"
  />
</Frame>

<Check>
The Tool Agent acts as the orchestrator, managing how your chat model interacts with external tools like Membit.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Add Buffer Memory">
Search for and add a **Buffer Memory** node to maintain conversation context.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/flowise/search-buffer.png" alt="Searching for Buffer Memory node in Flowise" />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Connect the Nodes">
Connect all the nodes to create a functioning chatflow:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/flowise/connect-tools.png"
    alt="Connected Flowise chatflow showing all nodes linked together"
  />
</Frame>

**Connection Pattern:**

- **Custom MCP** → **Tools** (Tool Agent)
- **ChatGoogleGenerativeAI** → **Tool Calling Chat Model** (Tool Agent)
- **Buffer Memory** → **Memory** (Tool Agent)

<Tip>
The visual connections show the data flow - the Tool Agent receives tools from Custom MCP, uses the chat model for responses, and maintains memory for context.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Test Your Chatflow">
Once all nodes are connected, test your chatflow by starting a conversation.

</Frame>

<Check>
Try asking questions like "What's trending in AI today?" or "Tell me about recent crypto news" to see Membit's real-time context in action.
