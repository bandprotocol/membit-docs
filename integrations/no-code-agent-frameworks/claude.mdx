Claude Desktop supports custom MCP integrations (currently in beta). By connecting Membit, you give Claude access to real-time social context—so it can answer with what's happening now across the web.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Claude Desktop installed (macOS or Windows)
- A Membit account with an API key [get your API key](/access-and-auth)
- Basic familiarity with editing configuration files

## Set up Membit Remote MCP

Follow these steps to enable the Membit MCP server in Claude Desktop:

<Steps>
<Step title="Create or open the Claude config file">
Use the correct path for your OS.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="macOS">

```bash
nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Windows">

```powershell
notepad C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
If the file doesn't exist, these commands will create it when you save.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Add the Membit MCP configuration">
Paste the following JSON into `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "membit-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.membit.ai/mcp",
        "--header",
        "X-Membit-Api-Key:${API_KEY}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "<your-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
Replace `<your-api-key>` with your actual Membit API key. Keep this credential secure and never share it publicly.
</Warning>

<Check>
Validate your JSON: ensure quotes are correct and there are no trailing commas.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Restart Claude Desktop">
  Completely quit and reopen Claude Desktop to load the new MCP configuration.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify the integration">
Open Claude and confirm the Membit MCP tools are available.

</Frame>

<Check>

</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Use Membit with Claude

Now that the integration is set, try a chat enhanced with real-time context:

<Steps>
<Step title="Start a new chat in Claude">
Open Claude Desktop and begin a conversation.
</Step>

<Step title="Ask context-aware questions">
Try prompts that benefit from up-to-the-minute context:

- "What's trending in AI today?"
- "Summarize the latest crypto news from real conversations"
- "What are people discussing about [your topic] right now?"

<Note>
  Claude may ask to run tools—allow tool usage so it can call the Membit MCP.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Config file not detected">
**Problem**: Claude doesn't load the MCP configuration.

**Solutions**:

- Verify the file path is exact for your OS:
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
  - Windows: `C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Ensure Claude Desktop was fully restarted after edits
- Confirm the file encoding is UTF-8 without BOM

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="JSON syntax errors">
**Problem**: Configuration fails to parse.

**Solutions**:

- Validate JSON with an online linter
- Remove trailing commas and ensure double quotes are used
- Confirm braces and brackets are properly matched

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="API key authentication fails">
**Problem**: Membit tools show auth errors.

**Solutions**:

- Ensure `env.API_KEY` contains your exact Membit API key
- Confirm the header name is `X-Membit-Api-Key` (case-sensitive)
- Regenerate your API key in Membit if issues persist

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Membit tools not appearing">
**Problem**: Tools don't show up in Claude.

**Solutions**:

- Double-check the `mcpServers` object name and structure
- Ensure `npx` is available on your system PATH
- Try adding `-y` to `npx` args (already included above)
- Restart Claude after any config changes

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Claude won't run tools">
**Problem**: Claude replies without using the MCP.

**Solutions**:

- Make prompts more explicit: "Use the available tools to check what's happening now about..."
