---

Enhance your VoltAgent applications with real-time social media context from Membit. This integration allows your AI agents to access up-to-the-minute discussions, trends, and insights from platforms like X (Twitter), Farcaster, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Node.js 20 or higher installed
- A Membit account with API access
- Basic familiarity with VoltAgent agents and workflows
- TypeScript knowledge (recommended)

<Warning>
You'll need valid Membit API credentials and the MCP remote URL. If you don't have access yet, [contact our team](mailto:hello@membit.io) to get started.
</Warning>

## Installation

Install the required packages for VoltAgent and MCP integration:

```bash
# Install VoltAgent core packages
npm install @voltagent/core
```

<Tip>
VoltAgent works best with TypeScript and structured logging. Make sure your project is configured accordingly.
</Tip>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
<Step title="Import required modules">
Import the necessary components for VoltAgent and MCP integration:

```typescript
import { VoltAgent, Agent, MCPConfiguration } from "@voltagent/core";
import { createPinoLogger } from "@voltagent/logger";
import { VercelAIProvider } from "@voltagent/vercel-ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure MCP connection">
Set up the MCP configuration to connect to Membit's tools:

```typescript
const mcpConfig = new MCPConfiguration({
  servers: {
    membit: {
      type: "streamable-http",
      url: "MEMBIT_REMOTE_MCP_URL",
      timeout: 15000, // Optional: Request timeout in milliseconds
    },
  },
});
```

<Note>
VoltAgent supports streamable HTTP transport for efficient MCP connections.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Create your Membit-powered agent">
Create a VoltAgent agent with Membit tools:

```typescript
const membitAgent = new Agent({
  name: "social-media-analyst",
  instructions: "You are a social media analyst with access to real-time data. Use cluster_search to find trending discussions, cluster_info for detailed analysis, and post_search for specific posts.",
  llm: new VercelAIProvider(),
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: await mcpConfig.getTools(),
});
```
</Step>

<Step title="Initialize VoltAgent system">
Create the VoltAgent system with your agent:

```typescript
// Initialize VoltAgent with your agent(s)
new VoltAgent({
  agents: {
    membitAgent,
  },
});
```

<Check>
Your VoltAgent is now powered by real-time social media context from Membit!
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Complete Example

Here's a full working example that demonstrates the integration:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Basic Integration
import { VoltAgent, Agent, MCPConfiguration } from "@voltagent/core";
import { createPinoLogger } from "@voltagent/logger";
import { VercelAIProvider } from "@voltagent/vercel-ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Configure MCP connection to Membit
const mcpConfig = new MCPConfiguration({
  servers: {
    membit: {
      type: "streamable-http",
      url: "MEMBIT_REMOTE_MCP_URL",
      timeout: 15000,
    },
  },
});

// Create Membit-powered agent
const socialAnalyst = new Agent({
  name: "membit-social-analyst",
  instructions: `You are an expert social media analyst with access to real-time trending data. 
  Use cluster_search to find trending discussions, cluster_info to dive deeper into specific conversations, 
  and post_search to find individual posts. Always provide context and source URLs.`,
  llm: new VercelAIProvider(),
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: await mcpConfig.getTools(),
});

// Initialize VoltAgent
const voltAgent = new VoltAgent({
  agents: {
    socialAnalyst,
  },
});
```

## Available Membit Tools

When you connect to the Membit MCP server through VoltAgent, your agents will have access to these powerful tools:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="cluster_search - Find Trending Discussions">
Get trending discussions across social platforms. This is the primary tool for finding topics of interest and understanding live conversations.

**Parameters:**
- `q` (string): Search query string
- `limit` (number, optional): Maximum number of results to return (default: 10)
- `output_format` (string, optional): Response format - "json" or "llm" (default: "json")
- `timeout` (number, optional): Request timeout in seconds (default: 60, max: 120)

**Returns:**
- `object`: Trending discussion clusters (when output_format="json")
- `string`: Formatted text response (when output_format="llm")

**Best for:** Finding what's trending, discovering popular topics, understanding current conversations
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="cluster_info - Deep Dive into Discussions">
Dive deeper into a specific trending discussion cluster. Use this to understand the context and participants of a particular conversation you discovered with `cluster_search`.

**Parameters:**
- `label` (string): Cluster label obtained from cluster_search
- `limit` (number, optional): Maximum number of results to return (default: 10)
- `output_format` (string, optional): Response format - "json" or "llm" (default: "json")
- `timeout` (number, optional): Request timeout in seconds (default: 60, max: 120)

**Returns:**
- `object`: Detailed cluster information (when output_format="json")
- `string`: Formatted text response (when output_format="llm")

**Best for:** Getting detailed context about specific conversations, understanding discussion participants
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="post_search - Search Raw Posts">
Search for raw social posts. Use this when you need to find specific posts, though `cluster_search` is recommended for finding trending discussions.

**Parameters:**
- `q` (string): Search query string
- `limit` (number, optional): Maximum number of results to return (default: 10)
- `output_format` (string, optional): Response format - "json" or "llm" (default: "json")
- `timeout` (number, optional): Request timeout in seconds (default: 60, max: 120)

**Returns:**
- `object`: Raw social posts (when output_format="json")
- `string`: Formatted text response (when output_format="llm")

**Best for:** Finding specific posts, getting raw social media content
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
For most use cases, start with `cluster_search` to find trending topics, then use `cluster_info` to dive deeper into interesting conversations. Use `post_search` only when you need specific individual posts.
</Tip>
