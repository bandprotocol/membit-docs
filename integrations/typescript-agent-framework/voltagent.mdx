Enhance your VoltAgent applications with real-time social media context from Membit. This integration allows your AI agents to access up-to-the-minute discussions, trends, and insights from platforms like X (Twitter), Farcaster, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Node.js 20 or higher installed
- A Membit account with API access
- Basic familiarity with VoltAgent agents and workflows
- TypeScript knowledge (recommended)

<Warning>
You'll need valid Membit API credentials and the MCP remote URL. If you don't have access yet, [get your API key](/access-and-auth) to get started.
</Warning>

## Installation

Install the required packages for VoltAgent and MCP integration:

```bash
# Install VoltAgent core packages
npm install @voltagent/core
```

<Tip>
VoltAgent works best with TypeScript and structured logging. Make sure your project is configured accordingly.
</Tip>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
<Step title="Import required modules">
Import the necessary components for VoltAgent and MCP integration:

```typescript
import { VoltAgent, Agent, MCPConfiguration } from "@voltagent/core";
import { createPinoLogger } from "@voltagent/logger";
import { VercelAIProvider } from "@voltagent/vercel-ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure MCP connection">
Set up the MCP configuration to connect to Membit's tools:

```typescript
const mcpConfig = new MCPConfiguration({
  servers: {
    membit: {
      type: "stdio",
      command: "npx",
      env: {
        MEMBIT_API_KEY: <your-api-key>,
      },
      args: [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.membit.ai/mcp",
        "--header",
        "X-Membit-Api-Key:${MEMBIT_API_KEY}",
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

<Note>
VoltAgent supports streamable HTTP transport for efficient MCP connections.
</Note>

<Warning>
Replace `<your-api-key>` with your actual Membit API key. Keep this credential secure and don't share it with unauthorized users.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Create your Membit-powered agent">
Create a VoltAgent agent with Membit tools:

```typescript
const membitAgent = new Agent({
  name: "social-media-analyst",
  instructions: "You are a social media analyst with access to real-time data. Use cluster_search to find trending discussions, cluster_info for detailed analysis, and post_search for specific posts.",
  llm: new VercelAIProvider(),
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: await mcpConfig.getTools(),
});
```
</Step>

<Step title="Initialize VoltAgent system">
Create the VoltAgent system with your agent:

```typescript
// Initialize VoltAgent with your agent(s)
new VoltAgent({
  agents: {
    membitAgent,
  },
});
```

<Check>
Your VoltAgent is now powered by real-time social media context from Membit!

</Step>
</Steps>

## Complete Example

Here's a full working example that demonstrates the integration:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Basic Integration
import { VoltAgent, Agent, MCPConfiguration } from "@voltagent/core";
import { createPinoLogger } from "@voltagent/logger";
import { VercelAIProvider } from "@voltagent/vercel-ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Configure MCP connection to Membit
const mcpConfig = new MCPConfiguration({
  servers: {
    membit: {
      type: "stdio",
      command: "npx",
      env: {
        MEMBIT_API_KEY: <your-api-key>,
      },
      args: [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.membit.ai/mcp",
        "--header",
        "X-Membit-Api-Key:${MEMBIT_API_KEY}",
      ],
    },
  },
});

// Create Membit-powered agent
const socialAnalyst = new Agent({
  name: "membit-social-analyst",
  instructions: `You are an expert social media analyst with access to real-time trending data. 
  Use cluster_search to find trending discussions, cluster_info to dive deeper into specific conversations, 
  and post_search to find individual posts. Always provide context and source URLs.`,
  llm: new VercelAIProvider(),
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: await mcpConfig.getTools(),
});

// Initialize VoltAgent
const voltAgent = new VoltAgent({
  agents: {
    socialAnalyst,
  },
});
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="MCP Connection Issues">
**Problem**: Cannot connect to Membit MCP server

**Solutions**:
- Verify your API key
- Check network connectivity and firewall settings
- Ensure the streamable HTTP endpoint is accessible
- Try increasing the timeout value in MCPConfiguration
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tool Loading Failures">
**Problem**: `mcpConfig.getTools()` returns empty or fails

**Solutions**:
- Ensure MCP configuration is correct with proper server settings
- Check that the Membit API key is valid
- Verify the MCP server URL is accessible
- Try initializing the MCP config in a try-catch block
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Workflow Execution Issues">
**Problem**: Workflows fail or don't execute properly

**Solutions**:
- Check agent dependencies and execution order
- Verify all required agents are properly registered
- Use structured logging to debug workflow steps
- Ensure agents have access to required tools
