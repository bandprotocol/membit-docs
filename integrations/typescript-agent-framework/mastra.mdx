---

Enhance your Mastra applications with real-time social media context from Membit. This integration allows your AI agents to access up-to-the-minute discussions, trends, and insights from platforms like X (Twitter), Farcaster, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Node.js 20 or higher installed
- A Membit account with API access
- Basic familiarity with Mastra agents
- TypeScript knowledge (recommended)

<Warning>
You'll need valid Membit API credentials and the MCP remote URL. If you don't have access yet, [contact our team](mailto:hello@membit.io) to get started.
</Warning>

## Installation

Install the required packages for Mastra and MCP integration:

```bash
# Install Mastra with MCP support
npm install @mastra/mcp@latest

# Install MCP remote client
npm install -g mcp-remote
```

<Tip>
Mastra works best with TypeScript. Make sure your project is configured for TypeScript development.
</Tip>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
<Step title="Import required modules">
Import the necessary components for Mastra and MCP integration:

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent';
import { LibSQLStore } from '@mastra/libsql';
import { MCPClient } from "@mastra/mcp";
```
</Step>

<Step title="Initialize MCP client">
Create an MCP client to connect to Membit's tools:

```typescript
export const mcp = new MCPClient({
  servers: {
    membit: {
      command: "npx",
      args: [
        "mcp-remote",
        "MEMBIT_REMOTE_MCP_URL"
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

<Note>
Make sure you have `mcp-remote` installed globally via npm for this to work.
</Note>

<Note>
Replace `MEMBIT_REMOTE_MCP_URL` with your actual Membit MCP URL provided.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Create your Membit-powered agent">
Create a Mastra agent with Membit tools and memory:

```typescript
export const membitAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'Social Media Analyst',
  instructions: `You are a social media analyst with access to real-time data. Use cluster_search to find trending discussions, cluster_info for detailed analysis, and post_search for specific posts.`,
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: await mcp.getTools(),
});
```
</Step>

<Step title="Use your agent">
Execute your agent with social media analysis tasks:

```typescript
const result = await membitAgent.generate(
  "What are the most trending discussions about AI today? Use cluster_search to find hot topics and provide insights with URLs."
);

console.log(result.text);
```

<Check>
Your Mastra agent is now powered by real-time social media context from Membit!
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Complete Example

Here's a full working example that demonstrates the integration:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Basic Integration
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent';
import { LibSQLStore } from '@mastra/libsql';
import { MCPClient } from "@mastra/mcp";

// Initialize MCP client for Membit
export const mcp = new MCPClient({
  servers: {
    membit: {
      command: "npx",
      args: [
        "mcp-remote",
        "MEMBIT_REMOTE_MCP_URL"
      ],
    },
  },
});

// Create Membit-powered agent
export const membitAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'Membit Social Analyst',
  instructions: `You are an expert social media analyst with access to real-time trending data. 
  Use cluster_search to find trending discussions, cluster_info to dive deeper into specific conversations, 
  and post_search to find individual posts. Always provide context and source URLs.`,
  model: openrouter("anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"),
  tools: await mcp.getTools(),
});

async function main() {
  try {
    const result = await membitAgent.generate(
      "What are the most trending discussions today related to Bitcoin? Use cluster_search to find hot topics and provide the best conversations to follow with URLs."
    );
    
    console.log("Analysis Results:");
    console.log(result.text);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error during analysis:", error);
  }
}

main();
```

## Available Membit Tools

When you connect to the Membit MCP server through Mastra, your agents will have access to these powerful tools:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="cluster_search - Find Trending Discussions">
Get trending discussions across social platforms. This is the primary tool for finding topics of interest and understanding live conversations.

**Parameters:**
- `q` (string): Search query string
- `limit` (number, optional): Maximum number of results to return (default: 10)
- `output_format` (string, optional): Response format - "json" or "llm" (default: "json")
- `timeout` (number, optional): Request timeout in seconds (default: 60, max: 120)

**Returns:**
- `object`: Trending discussion clusters (when output_format="json")
- `string`: Formatted text response (when output_format="llm")

**Best for:** Finding what's trending, discovering popular topics, understanding current conversations
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="cluster_info - Deep Dive into Discussions">
Dive deeper into a specific trending discussion cluster. Use this to understand the context and participants of a particular conversation you discovered with `cluster_search`.

**Parameters:**
- `label` (string): Cluster label obtained from cluster_search
- `limit` (number, optional): Maximum number of results to return (default: 10)
- `output_format` (string, optional): Response format - "json" or "llm" (default: "json")
- `timeout` (number, optional): Request timeout in seconds (default: 60, max: 120)

**Returns:**
- `object`: Detailed cluster information (when output_format="json")
- `string`: Formatted text response (when output_format="llm")

**Best for:** Getting detailed context about specific conversations, understanding discussion participants
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="post_search - Search Raw Posts">
Search for raw social posts. Use this when you need to find specific posts, though `cluster_search` is recommended for finding trending discussions.

**Parameters:**
- `q` (string): Search query string
- `limit` (number, optional): Maximum number of results to return (default: 10)
- `output_format` (string, optional): Response format - "json" or "llm" (default: "json")
- `timeout` (number, optional): Request timeout in seconds (default: 60, max: 120)

**Returns:**
- `object`: Raw social posts (when output_format="json")
- `string`: Formatted text response (when output_format="llm")

**Best for:** Finding specific posts, getting raw social media content
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
For most use cases, start with `cluster_search` to find trending topics, then use `cluster_info` to dive deeper into interesting conversations. Use `post_search` only when you need specific individual posts.
</Tip>
