## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Membit?">
    Membit is a Context-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that gives your AI agents
    and analytics tools a direct line to what's happening in the world right
    now. We provide a constantly updated knowledge base built from global social
    discussions, so your AI is always equipped with the freshest context.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How is Membit different from other data providers or social listening tools?">
    Traditional social listening tools are built for marketing dashboards.
    Membit is built for AI. Instead of just raw data, we provide structured,
    high-signal "context" that AI agents can easily understand and use. This
    allows you to build applications that don't just report on the "what," but
    understand the "why" behind real-time events.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Who is Membit for?">
    Membit is for anyone building with AI who needs access to real-time world
    context. It's especially powerful for:

    - **AI Developers & Agent Builders:** Create smarter, more aware
      applications.
    - **Financial Analysts:** Spot market-moving trends and sentiment shifts as
      they emerge.
    - **Media & Content Creators:** Discover viral stories and generate timely
      content.
    - **Brands & Marketers:** Monitor brand health and gain competitive
      intelligence.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is Membit free to use during the beta period?">
    Yes! During our beta, Membit is free for both personal and business use. We
    provide a generous starting allocation of API credits, and you can request
    more anytime by joining our [Discord](https://discord.bandprotocol.com)
    community.

## For Data Hunters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the Membit Data Hunter program?">
    The Membit Data Hunter program is a decentralized community that rewards you
    for helping build a real-time context layer for AI. Using our browser
    extension, you can gather public social data that makes AI models smarter
    and more aware of current events. In return for your contributions, you earn
    points and status.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What kind of content qualifies?">
    We look for high-signal, timely, and publicly available content. Think
    breaking announcements, expert analysis, and emerging trends. The goal is to
    capture credible information that adds real value to a discussion and helps
    AI understand the world more accurately.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does the rewards system work?">
    You earn points for every piece of valuable data you contribute. Our system
    rewards you for both the quality of the information and for being early to
    spot a trend. Points can be redeemed for perks like API credits, and top
    contributors get recognized on our global leaderboard.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How is my contribution reviewed and used?">
    Your contributions go through our automated pipeline where AI validates each
    post, filters out noise, and groups related content into "discussion
    clusters." This structured context is then made available to developers, who
    use it to build smarter, context-aware AI applications.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What about privacy and data usage?">
    Your privacy is a core principle. The extension only processes publicly
    available data. It does not access private messages, personal profiles, or
    paywalled content. You participate as a pseudonymous contributor, and we do
    not sell personal user data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I get started and contribute effectively?">
    Install the Chrome extension and browse the web as you normally would. To
    maximize your rewards, focus on your areas of expertise. Your unique
    knowledge helps you spot high-signal content that others might miss,
    increasing the value of your contribution to the network.
  </Accordion>

## For Developers & API Users

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How can I access Membit's data?">
    We offer several ways to access our data to fit your workflow. You can use
    our straightforward RESTful API, connect to our MCP server for real-time
    streams, or use our official client libraries for Python and TypeScript.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What kind of data can I get from the Membit API?">
    The API provides access to structured "discussion clusters." These are
    collections of related social media posts, articles, and other content
    centered around a specific topic or event. Your AI agents can search for
    these clusters using natural language and then dive into the underlying
    content to understand what real people are saying and how conversations are
    evolving.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How up-to-date is the data?">
    Our data is updated continuously. Our global network of Data Hunters
    contributes new content 24/7, and we run our clustering and analysis
    pipeline every hour. This ensures the context you provide to your AI is
    always fresh and relevant.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What are API credits and how are they calculated?">
    During our beta, every user starts with 500 API credits and receives an
    additional 100 credits each day. Credits are used to pay for API calls, with
    different endpoints having different costs based on their complexity. This
    system ensures you only pay for the value you receive.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are there rate limits for the API?">
    Your usage is primarily governed by your available API credits rather than a
    traditional requests-per-second rate limit. As long as you have credits, you
    can make calls. If you have high-volume needs, please
    [reach out to us on Discord](https://discord.bandprotocol.com) to discuss a
    custom plan.
