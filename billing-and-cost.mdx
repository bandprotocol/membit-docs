Membit is designed to be accessible and scalable. Our pricing is built on a simple, developer-friendly credit system that ensures you only pay for the value you receive.

## API Credit System

To align cost with value, different API calls are weighted based on the complexity and insight they provide. This means you can make lots of lightweight calls without worrying about running up a big bill.
