During our beta period, Membit is available with liberal limits, free of charge. We want to encourage developers to build and experiment with our platform without worrying about costs.

### Beta Access

As a beta user, you'll have access to all of Membit's features. We may introduce rate limiting to ensure a stable experience for all users, but our goal is to provide you with as much access as possible.

### Custom Data Pipelines

If you have specific needs that aren't met by our standard API, we also offer customized data pipelines. Whether you need higher throughput, specialized data sources, or custom processing, we can work with you to create a solution that fits your requirements.

For more information on custom pipelines or to discuss your specific use case, please [contact us](mailto:hi@membit.ai).
