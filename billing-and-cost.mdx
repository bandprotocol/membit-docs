Membit offers flexible, value-based plans designed to scale with your needs. Our strategy is built on a developer-friendly credit system, clear upgrade paths, and a unique growth loop powered by our Data Hunter community.

## API Credit System

To align cost with value, API calls are weighted differently based on their complexity and the insight they provide.
