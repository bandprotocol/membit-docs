## Core Strengths

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Insights by Real Humans" icon="users">
    LLMs are great at reasoning and general knowledge but lack the context of
    what's going on in the real world. Membit's data is sourced by a global
    network of **Data Hunters** who surface valuable, real-time content,
    providing a layer of human-validated relevance that automated systems can't
    match.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Real-Time by Design" icon="bolt">
    Membit's data is clustered and refreshed in real-time, enabling AI agents to
    react to the ever-changing global landscape. Our architecture is built for
    speed, surfacing conversations in minutes, not hours.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Diverse & Global" icon="globe">
    Our data is contributed by a diverse set of Data Hunters from all over the
    world, providing a global perspective on emerging trends and discussions.

## The In-Context Learning Revolution

The future of effective AI lies in smaller, more efficient models augmented by a continuous stream of relevant data. Membit addresses the critical flaw of "data staleness" in traditional LLMs by providing an evergreen feed of high-value context for any AI application.
