Anyone can become a contributor to Membit's data pool by installing the Membit browser extension. As a Data Hunter, you'll play a crucial role in helping us build the world's most relevant real-time context engine.

## How it Works

The Membit browser extension allows you to contribute public social posts to our data pool. Here's how to get started:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Extension">
    You can download the Membit extension from the [Google Chrome Web
    Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in with X">
    To get started, you'll need to sign in with your X (formerly Twitter)
    account. This allows us to attribute your contributions and reward you with
    points.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Browse Social Media">
    The extension currently supports X, Farcaster, and Bluesky. As you browse
    these platforms, the extension will automatically digest the public posts
    you're seeing and report them to our servers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Earn Rewards">
    Every epoch (which happens every 60 minutes), your contributions are
    rewarded in Points. These points can be redeemed for various rewards in the
    future.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The Membit browser extension only has access to public posts. No private
  posts, personal data, or messages are ever accessed or shared.
