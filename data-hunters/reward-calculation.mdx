title: "Reward Calculation"
---

Data Hunters can earn Points every epoch (30 minutes) based on their contributions.

### How It Works

- Each epoch, you can earn up to a certain cap, which starts at **10,000 points**.
- If you reach the maximum cap in the current epoch, your cap for the next epoch will increase, allowing you to earn even more.
- The maximum cap is **200,000 points** per epoch (20x the starting cap).

### How Points Are Calculated

Membit rewards posts with several key qualities:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Engagement">
    The more engaging a post is (likes, shares, comments), the more points
    you'll be rewarded for contributing it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Uniqueness">
    If a post is reported by multiple Data Hunters, the points are shared among
    them. Reporting high-engagement posts in a unique niche that few others are
    covering is a great strategy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Timeliness">
    The more recent a post is, the more points you'll earn. Freshness is key.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Relevancy">
    Only posts that are included in a discussion cluster are eligible to earn
    points.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>{" "}
