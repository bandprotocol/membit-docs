Your curiosity deserves to be rewarded. As a Data Hunter, you earn points every epoch (every 60 minutes) based on the quality and impact of the content you share. Here’s a breakdown of how you can maximize your earnings.

## How Your Points Are Calculated

Membit rewards posts with multiple qualities:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Engagement" icon="arrow-up-right-dots">
    The more a post resonates with the community (think likes, replies, and
    shares), the more points it’s worth. High-engagement content is highly
    valued.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Uniqueness" icon="gem">
    Be the first to spot a gem. If multiple Data Hunters report the same post,
    the points are shared. To maximize your rewards, focus on sharing unique,
    high-quality content that others might miss.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Timeliness" icon="clock">
    The world moves fast, and so should you. The newer a post is, the more
    points you'll earn for discovering it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Relevancy" icon="check">
    Your contributions help build a clearer picture of what's happening. Points
    are awarded for posts that are grouped into a larger trend or topic (a
    cluster), ensuring every piece of data adds meaningful context.

## Grow Your Earning Potential

We believe in rewarding consistent, high-quality contributions. Every Data Hunter starts with an earning cap of **10,000 points** per epoch (every 60 minutes).

When you hit your cap, we raise it for the next epoch, allowing you to earn even more. Keep contributing great content, and you can grow your cap up to a maximum of **200,000 points** per epoch—that's 20 times the starting potential! It's our way of saying thanks for being an active part of the membit community.
