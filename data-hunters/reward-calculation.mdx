Data Hunters can earn points every epoch (every 30 minutes) based on the quality and uniqueness of their contributions. Here's how it works:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How Points are Calculated">
    Membit rewards posts with multiple qualities:
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Engagement" icon="arrow-up-right-dots">
        The more engaging a post is (likes, replies, etc.), the more points
        you'll be rewarded.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Uniqueness" icon="gem">
        If a post is reported by multiple Data Hunters, the points are shared
        among them. Reporting high-quality, niche content is a great way to earn
        more points.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Timeliness" icon="clock">
        The more recent a post is, the more points you'll earn.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Relevancy" icon="check">
        Only posts that are included in a cluster are eligible to earn points.
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Earning Caps">
    Each epoch, you can earn up to a certain cap, which starts at **10,000
    points**. If you reach your cap in a given epoch, your cap for the next
    epoch will increase. This allows you to earn more as you contribute more.
    The maximum cap is **200,000 points** per epoch (20x the starting cap).
