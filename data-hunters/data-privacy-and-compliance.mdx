We are committed to protecting the privacy of our Data Hunters and ensuring that our platform is compliant with all relevant regulations.

The Data Hunter chrome extension acts as an automated tool for hunters to contribute **public social posts** they are viewing to Membit. This is similar to how your browsing history might be used to personalize advertising, but instead of serving ads, we use this data to make AI agents smarter and more useful for everyone.

<Note>
  Only publicly available posts are shared with Membit. **No private posts,
  personal data, or direct messages are ever accessed or shared.** We are
  committed to ensuring the privacy and security of our users' data.
