The Data Hunter Chrome extension acts as an automated tool for hunters to contribute **public** social posts they are viewing to Membit.

This is similar to how your browsing activity might be used by advertising companies, but with a key difference: instead of using this data to serve you ads, we use it to make AI agents smarter and more useful for everyone.

- **Only public data is shared:** The extension only accesses and shares publicly available posts.
- **No private data is accessed:** No private posts, direct messages, or other personal data is ever accessed or shared with Membit. We are committed to protecting your privacy.
